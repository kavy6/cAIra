# cAIra

cAIra is a face recognition/emotion detection chatbot which would help gain insight into the user’s emotional and mental state.
Mental health professionals (such as counsellors and psychologists) can use the data collected by the app to personalise treatment for their clients and address key issues.
It uses facial recognition and emotion detection in a live environment to get the user’s details (i.e. name and emotion).
Then, the user can talk to cAIra and their responses are recorded in a database.
